- **Assignment 1**: Tail inequalities for binomial distribution_ Bin\((n, \frac{1}{2})\)

The goal of this task is to compare bounds obtained using Markov's and Chebyshev's inequalities for the "tails" of the binomial distribution Bin\((n, \frac{1}{2})\) for \(n \in \{100, 1000, 10000\}\) with exact values of the estimated probabilities.

Let \(X \sim Bin(n, \frac{1}{2})\). Apply Markov's inequality and Chebyshev's inequality to estimate:

(a) \(P(X > 1 \frac{1}{5} E(X))\),

(b) \(P(|X - E(X)| > \frac{1}{10} E(X))\).

To calculate exact probabilities of these events, use a mathematical package/numerical computation library. In your solution, utilize the fact that the Bin\((n, \frac{1}{2})\) distribution is symmetric.

Present (e.g., in a table) and briefly discuss the obtained results. Which inequality provides more accurate estimates?
